# Green-Task-force

A web application with a PHP backend that lets its registered members pin a location on a map(created using google map API) with information such as a description 
and accurate address to collect garbage.
These pinned locations will the be viewed by a logged in "Captain" who confirms the valid locations and if staff are needed to pick up the garbage.
Such collecting staff are then able to view a separate map that shows only the confirmed locations along with the description posted by the members.
